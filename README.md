Team CHS is proud to present our entry for the DOST's Robotics Camp & Coding Competition, Robot Story Making category. Our team is comprised of Jeffrey Galino as the trainer, Danielle Adan as the main programmer, Leinard Flores who created the story and map illustrations, and Danielle Adan who also visualized and designed the map. We utilized the INEX C Robot Simulator to bring our robot story to life.
